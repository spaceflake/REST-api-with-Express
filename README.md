# REST-API for adding members with Express.js and React

## The community book

_Is a record keeper to see, add, edit and delete members._

---

This is an individual assignment from my school.\
The assignment is to create a REST-API using NodeJS with Express.
The API has 5 endpoints GET, GET/single, DELETE, PUT, POST.\
All data is saved in a JSON file.
The single endpoint is used for editing an existing record.

For the front I used create-react-app.

- Listing current members with edit/delete
- Form to create/edit member.
- Using animations and toast notifications.
